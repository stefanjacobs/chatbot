# Sir-Bot-A-Lot - A highly customizable chatbot for desktop work

This is chatbot that lets you implement custom python skills in a simple way.

It features:

- **Simple**: It is easy to use and customize. The complex features are locked away and hidden behind a simple interfaces.
- **Customizable**: You can create your own skills and add them to the bot by implementing an abstract class.
- **Intent detection**: When implementing your own skills, you can set up samples that the bot can be trained upon.
- **Trainable**: You can train the bot on your own skills and samples by using `tensorflow` and `keras`.
- **Entity detection**: Entity detection is implemented using `spacy` to add parameters to your skill.
- **Async voice output**: The bot speaks the voice output asynchronously to the user by using `pyttsx3`.




## Installation

This repository uses `poetry` to manage dependencies. So start by installing `poetry` and then run `poetry install`. When finished, you can run `make run` to start the bot.

```bash
$ poetry run python3 app.py

## TODOs

[]: More skills, e.g. Work time tracking, open mail, write new mail, open browser with search
[]: Is it possible to implement dialogs using this system?
[]: Stupid tensorflow warnings should be left out of the output
[]: Voice Input - simple.
[]: Voice Activation - need to do some research.
[]: Help skill intent name is only `hel`. Why is that and how can it be fixed?
[]: Voice output is very slow, very very slow. How can that be fixed?
[]: Voice output with different intonations (there are at least 30 on my system), configurable?
